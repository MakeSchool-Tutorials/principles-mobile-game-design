You're on your way to becoming a full fledged iOS developer - now is the time to start prototyping the game you are going to work on once you finish the tutorials.

Why now? You may not even be ready to start working on your game yet! If there's trend we've observed in the games we help folks build and publish, it's that the good ones were played a lot by people who were not the developers at all stages in development. The time to get in the habit of constantly testing with real people is now.

##Paper Prototyping
Almost every game will benefit from prototyping. You can iterate much faster on paper than in code, at least when you're starting from scratch, so we're going to recommend strongly you start, as soon as possible, prototyping your game on paper before writing a single line of code.

First, you'll need materials to prototype with. Paper, pencil, and rulers to trace out grids and levels are a must. Paper with a hex pattern on it or pre-gridded with 1-inch or larger squares is nice and can typically be found any store that carries DnD supplies or with a quick search on Amazon. Dice to simulate some sort of random generation and different kinds of bits - poker chips, tokens, etc... to stand in for characters, enemies, and other elements of your game are useful as well.

##Who does What?
Almost all successful mobile games are single player or turn based multiplayer. Very few to none are synchronous multiplayer, meaning both players play at the same time. Thus to test your game prototype you'll only need two people.

You will play as the "computer" and/or as the player on the other end of the turn based game. You are going to simulate the game environment for the other player.

The other player, presumably a friend of yours, is going to interact with the environment you are going to set up.

##Questions to Answer
The core question you have to answer is: why is my game fun?

This is something that you can get partially right and partially wrong in subtle ways.

Maybe you thought the fun in your infinite runner game was all about how far the player got, so you were scoring them based on distance. You may find out that most exciting to have long streaks without hitting obstacles, and you should instead score players on how long their streaks are.

Maybe you thought that the fun in level five of your puzzle game that you could blow up TNT to clear certain blocks out of the way. You may find out that players get frustrated trying to figure out what to do with the TNT, but LOVE blowing stuff up once they've figure it out. You should instead TELL players up front how to use the TNT, and then create levels that take advantage of the TNT.

These are the kinds of thing you can start figuring out at the paper prototyping stage. It also serves as an extended brainstorm session - by forcing your ideas onto paper and showing them to someone else, you'll come up with new better ideas.
