TL;DR: Development time will take 5-10X longer than you think, start with a small manageable game, developing your second game will be smoother than developing your first.

Do you know the best way to sell 0 copies of your game? Never release it. It's that easy!

The most spectacular failures of the game industry are not games that launched and flopped, but rather games that never launched at all. From Dragon Empires to Starcraft Ghost, there are plenty of examples of even professionals getting too ambitious and never finishing their games.

These represent hundreds of millions of dollars of development, all for nothing because the game was never released. Why? Over-scoping.

##Done is Better Than Perfect##
To keep scope in check, your first game shouldn't be your dream game. It sounds harsh, but it really isn't. You may think that by building a simpler game, you're not contributing to your ultimate goal of building your dream game. The good news is, that simply isn't true.

The first game you make will take longer than expected. It will be sloppy. It will be an amazing learning experience. And when you finish it, you will join a special club in the game industry, that of the game developer who shipped his/her game.

We know companies that raised millions of dollars and never shipped a single game. Millions. True story. There are people in the game industry who have worked for years of their lives on games, and yet never had a single real player in the wild play their games because their games were never released.

But guess what? The second game you make will go much, much, much, smoother. You'll be able to re-use a lot of the code from your first game, you won't make all the mistakes you made the first time around, and most crucially it will turn out way better than if you had tried to make it the first time around.

We promise. Not to mention that if you prove to us you can finish one game, we'll go out of our way to help you make your second.
